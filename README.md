### Bugs

**Solved bugs**

- When I deployed to GitHub pages, i noticed the social media logo's were not showing up on the Gallery or sign up pages.
- I discovered this was because I had not added the font awesome link to the head on these pages.
- included the link on all head sections, problem cleared.
  
- When I deployed to GitHub pages, I noted that the images on the Gallery were not loading.
- I found that I had used absolute file paths for these images
- I removed the starting / making them relative file paths, solving the problem.
